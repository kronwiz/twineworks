# linkdropdown macro

This macro was written for Twine [SugarCube](http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/) story format.

The purpose of this macro is to add a dropdown menu to a link. In other words, when you click on a link an overlay opens just below the link: in this area you can add everything you want using SugarCube markup.

I developed it to list all the action available on an object, like this:

Of course you can change colors and spacings with the CSS stylesheet.

You can see here a [working demo](demo.html).
